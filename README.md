# Description
The website is divided into seven categories. The Welcome Section, About Section, Services Section, What We Do Section, Portfolio Section, Contact Us, and Footer are all included. Users may explore the site and see what Delan Studio does, with additional information available when they click on the photos in the "What we Do" section. Users may also go through the portfolio photos of the studio's work.
# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
1. Clicking on the image under "what we do" section will bring up a text describing the service.
2. When you hover your mouse over an image in the "portfolio" section, a white box containing the image's name appears.
3. When you fill out the contact-us form, your information and message will be forwarded to mailchimp, and you will     receive a confirmation message thanking you for contacting them.
4. In the event that the submit form is submitted without any values, a warning message will pop up, instructing you to fill up the form with correct information.
